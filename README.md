# LvilleCourseSelection
For my Senior Project, I moved my school's course selection system, which was formally paper-based, online. The website filters the courses by grade and term. I also included a catalog mode so that users could read course descriptions. It also checks user input for duplicate selections and outputs the courses as a CSV file.
