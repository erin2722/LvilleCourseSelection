1016,English,HU201,Humanities - English,"This year-long English class stresses the development of students' skills in writing and grammar close reading and discussion while introducing them to some of the works in the literary canon. The course begins with an intensive writing period refreshing skills in description and narration while focusing on the students' place at Lawrenceville and in the greater community. We use modern and ancient stories to spur our thinking and discussion. Many sections study Antigone or one of the Platonic dialogues as vehicles through which we introduce and practice close reading and Harkness skills. Having deliberately outlined these skills we move on to read the story of the Monkey King The Ramayana Homer's Odyssey a Shakespeare play Bible stories from the Old and the New Testaments The Catcher in the Rye and several shorter works. Reading focuses primarily on the Western tradition with some work connected to the freshman theater production in the winter and modern India in the spring. While much of the writing students do in this course focuses on forming an argument and using a text to support the steps of that argument students also write for a variety of purposes including to express themselves to explore and come to understand complicated ideas and to imitate stylistic and formal features of the authors they study. Working in tandem with Humanities Cultural Studies Humanities English builds a foundation of skills and knowledge for the beginning student of the humanities.

1780,English,EN520,From Freud To The Void,"First off we ground ourselves carefully in the rudiments of Sigmund Freud's scandalous psychoanalytic theory (The Rat Man and Civilization and its Discontents). Then we pick up the trail of the good doctor as it surfaces in the America Dream of the early 1950s. We pursue it psychoanalytically through the post-war mannerists of repression like John Cheever and J.D. Salinger who explored some possible modes of behavior in response to the Freudian predicament. We then turn to the libidinous Beats (Jack Kerouac Allen Ginsberg Gregory Corso and William Burroughs) who reshaped the project into the apocalyptic postures that were politicized in the 60s commercialized and/or pastoralized in the 70s romanticized in the 80s then detoxed and archived on t-shirts for our own new century. Last stop: Hunter S. Thompson. Course work includes three essays and a final paper.

In workshops we meet over each story for a full class period and then over a second draft to smooth the rough edges. The final third draft becomes a culmination of persistence and commitment that richly rewards the writer's efforts and that results in a mature piece which the writer will be confident enough and proud to share. Not only for self-identified writers this class by virtue of its interest in representing human beings through stories also gives students a chance to share their experiences of the world and their insights into what makes it - and us people - tick.

The victors in a war may assume the right to compose the history of the conflict but often the losers write the enduring fiction-and thus win that other and unending battle that takes place in the human heart. We'll read works by the likes of Eudora Welty Ernest J. Gaines Flannery O'Connor Richard Wright Peter Taylor Carson McCullers and above all William Faulkner. We'll read them in part to see the effects of that external war the South lost but mostly to discover how well the South has reversed that historical judgment or redeemed itself through art.

All of the plays involve both physical and figurative masks and each raises questions about the morality of hiding one's true identity behind a false front. Video versions of each of the plays supplement the texts and if we have an opportunity to see a live show in the area we will take advantage of that.

1276,English,EN547,The Screwball Comedy,"This elective will look closely at the genre that has come to be called ""screwball comedy"": comedies that see a romance through mischance and difficulty before ending in ""felicity"" as Jane Austen might say.  We�ll start with Shakespeare looking closely at Much Ado About Nothing and what seems to be its companion tragedy Othello before turning our attention to Hollywood�s versions of the genre from the 1930s and 40s and eventually a contemporary novel (which Eugenides quite explicitly titles The Marriage Plot).  In order to give us both a critical eye for detail and social context along the way we�ll dig into some of the informative criticism that has sprung up in the wake of the genre.  (Cavell goes so far as to call this new genre ""the comedy of equality"" (82).)  Our framing questions will include the following: ""What defines the genre of screwball/romantic comedy?""  ""What social and philosophical concerns do these stories reveal?""  ""Where does comedy begin and end?""  ""Why does comedy often waver so close to being tragedy?"" ""What do these comedies suggest about the nature of happiness in romantic relationships?""

In this course we will look at three novels (William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Chronicle of a Death Foretold Nicole Krauss' recent novel The History of Love (2005)) that attempt to make sense of people and events that apparently defy logic or understanding. While all three novels tell compelling gripping stories-of a family in the American South of the Holocaust of a murder in a small South American village-they also force us to think about the nature of time and history and the vagaries of human memory.

1643,English,EN552,Children's Literature,"As children we live in a world of exciting unfamiliarity stepping day after day on the path of curious possibility.  Each moment is a new redefining experience that can reveal the rich beauty or crushing disappointment of being. No matter what the capricious moment provides children have a peculiar and charming magical power the power of escape. To retreat into the private space of the imagination a space unbound by the limits of the rational world.  Sometime alas later on in life we grow up. And as George Bernard Shaw notes in his play Major Barbara ""You have learned something. That always feels at first as if you had lost something."" Have we lost the magic of what was? Can it never be again? This course will examine seminal texts written for children and attempt to see the ever-present wonder that exists through this unique perceptual frame. We will ask what are the archetypical themes that speak so deeply to the foundational experience of the age.  In order to complement our study we will pair each text with a more mature work of art and consider how the archetypes still resonate but undergo a transformation for adult eyes. Why is the hungry caterpillar so hungry and what does it have to do with Kafka�s human yearning? Where are those wild things and where are they now? What do the immortal 5 Chinese Brothers (and their questionable morality) have to do with Oscar Wilde�s The Picture of Dorian Gray? To conclude your senior year with a creative flourish we will write and construct our own children�s book.  Sign up if you dare: ""Let the wild rumpus start!""

1277,English,EN554,Chaucer: Text and Context,"Focusing on the work of Geoffrey Chaucer this course explores both a rich and extraordinary text and the culture of the late medieval world. Using chapters from Barbara Tuchman�s A Distant Mirror to understand the contradictions of what she calls the ""calamitous 14th Century"" we will see how Chaucer's Canterbury Tales often depict an individual subject struggling against self-contradictory social forces. The various pilgrims give us chances to examine issues of gender and class in conjunction with themes of justice and exclusion. Though many of the readings in this course are in Middle English no previous experience with the dialect is required. We will read slowly at the beginning of the course paying close attention to the language as our translation skills develop.

1004,English,EN556,Modern English Plays,"It has been said that the world has never seen a greater period of change than the 20th century and the modern stage has artfully reflected the confusion and excitement of that time. In the first half of the century England was involved in two World Wars the sobering effects of which can be clearly seen on the British stage. The snobbery and waste of the upper classes that was once a great source for comedy was now a more appropriate theme for tragedy and humor found itself rooted in the existentialist idea of absurdity itself. This elective will look closely at this change in the theater through three playwrights: one from the late 1800s and two from the middle and late 20th century. We will read six plays over the term and write an essay on each of the three authors. The class itself will be text and discussion based but it will also include films and our own oral interpretations of the plays around the Harkness table. Texts may include: Wilde's The Importance of Being Ernest and An Ideal Husband J.B.

It played host to some of the most important intellectual discoveries in human history including Marxism psychoanalysis linguistics symbolic logic set theory quantum mechanics and evolutionary theory. And yet we still so often think of the Victorian era as just that stuffy prudish altogether boring interlude between the so much more interesting Romantic and Modernist movements. In this course we will quash such thinking by reading the era�s novelists poets and playwrights who vigorously embraced and industriously represented the most radical progressive and eccentric aspects of Victorian life. From a poem that envisions subatomic particles as a link with a dead lover to a novel that uses evolution as a model for new societal structures to a play that uses logical paradoxes to toy with questions of identity and sexuality: we will explore how Victorian authors experimented with avant-garde literary forms even as they pushed the traditional boundaries between art technology mathematics philosophy and science. Readings may include Matthew Arnold Elizabeth Barrett Browning Lewis Carroll Charles Darwin Albert Einstein George Eliot Sigmund Freud Henry James Karl Marx Dante and Christina Rossetti Alfred Tennyson and Oscar Wilde. We will also look at some very early photography and cinema as well as developments in visual arts like the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the Arts and Crafts movement.

1017,English,EN559,The Graphic Novel,"The graphic novel is an aesthetically innovative genre in which meaning is created through the interplay of image and text. How do we read a novel in which two narrative channels - one verbal the other visual - interact? What can this multi-modal genre do that other literary genres cannot? And how might it challenge readers to expand the set of interpretive techniques that make up ""close reading""? This course will investigate the renaissance of graphic narrative that has taken place in the last 25 years. Students who are thinking about enrolling should be aware that we will not be taking up the superhero and science-fiction traditions of long-form comics. Instead we will pursue a more recent tradition of graphic narrative that grapples with pressing social and political issues ranging from the Holocaust (Maus) and the Iranian Revolution (Persepolis) to sexuality (Fun Home) and disability (Building Stories). How might the form of the graphic novel be particularly well-suited for grappling with such topics? And how have graphic novelists employed the formal components of the genre - panel frames gutters bleeds splash pages motion lines and so on - to create meaning within individual works? Primary texts will include Art Spiegelman�s Maus: A Survivor�s Tale (1986/1991) Marjane Satrapi�s Persepolis (2003/2004) Alison Bechdel�s Fun Home (2006) and Chris Ware�s Building Stories (2012).

378,English,EN561,Storytelling in Literature and Film,"Think of this course as one that aims to dissect the anatomy of stories both written and filmed:  What can a story accomplish?  How do stories work? In this course we will look at the narrative form as it has evolved in world literature and film attending to genre and to how knowing ""what kind of story we are in"" informs our expectations as readers/viewers.  As we move from the old familiar form of the folk tale to mystery stories (Conan Doyle) surrealist mystery stories (Borges) a post-modern novel (either Calvino or Nabokov) and several films (including Hitchcock) we will track how these narratives work on us how they draw on historical narrative traditions and (in some cases) how they subvert our concept of traditional storytelling.  Expect to learn to ""read"" a film scene as text write several papers co-lead several discussions and ask essential questions about how stories work on us as readers listeners and watchers...and why we need them.

What gets �lost in translation�?  Others argue that translation is actually also a process of creation asking �What is found?� Literary translations and translation theory help us consider how cultures share literature and inspire one another including how multilingual writers use language code-switching and code-mixing and examine the limits and responsibilities of the translator.  We analyze works from poets� dramatists� and theorists� works such as the play Translations by Brian Friel Gloria Anzaldua�s Borderlands / La Frontera: The New Mestiza and Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei from Weinberger and Paz and then try putting theory into practice ourselves.

But what if the literature itself goes against our expectations of what stories and characters ought to do?  In this course we study fictional presentations and critical theories of gender sexuality and other identities in an attempt to understand how gender has been and is constructed and commodified in the past right now and every day.  How do these constructs intersect with other identities such as race social class or nationality and help us understand the relationship between literary and material culture?  This course will examine historical and cultural contexts to better analyze the rise of female anonymous and pseudonymous writers in the 19th century and both the reinforcement of and challenge to Western gender roles in the 20th century by the increasingly visible subcultures and vocal subaltern.

However protection from discrimination by private actors securing legal recognition of the romantic union of one�s choice and having access to publicly provided education among others are arguably important aspects of �full citizenship� that Americans have been arguing about since the founding of the republic.

1703,History,HI584,The Athenian Century - The Rise and Fall of Athens,"The Fifth Century BCE is at the center of the Classical Age in ancient Greece and Athens is at the center of the Classical Age. Athenians witnessed among other things the original experiment in democracy the refinement of what we now call politics the birth of the idea of inquiry into the real past which we now call history and the beginnings of medicine geometry philosophy physics and drama. They put the Muse in music. They did not invent sculpture but took it to classical heights as they did with architecture. Theirs was not the first alphabet but they vastly refined what they took from the Phoenicians principally by adding vowels and then wrote everything down in a wholly new style called prose. Yes they invented prose. They were reflexively competitive (witness the PanHellenic games at Olympia Delphi Isthmia and Corinth and the dramatic competitions). They were united by language religion and trade but fragmented by geography into a thousand separate city states or poleis from which we get words such as politics and policy.
The ambitious readings in this course will include a combination of essays plays and historical texts in translation to answer questions such as: How do we know what the classical Greek world was like? What did it mean to be Greek? How do philology and archaeology bring us history? What makes the Fifth Century BCE central? Why did democracy emerge in Athens and why did it ultimately fail? How did Plato and Aristotle respond to that failure? How does Athenian culture from pottery to sculpture reflect humanism? What did Athenian tragedy and comedy have to do with politics and competitiveness? What was the role of women and of religion and of the PanHellenic games?

1044,History,HI587,Reporting Vietnam,"This discussion-based course asks: What is history and how do we write it? It is less a history of the Vietnam War than a history of how the press covered it. Journalists often claim that their work is the first rough draft of history. In Vietnam their work-both in print and on television-was controversial and influential. Students in this course will study that work in order to address questions such as: Was the press a spectator or did it become part of the drama? Did journalists capture history's first rough draft or did they leave behind a record that is ultimately tainted? Did the correspondents do what was right and if so right for whom? Were they professionals or were they subversives? If their work was not the first rough draft of history then what was it? Did the press ""lose"" Vietnam? Did the rise of television turn the role of the journalist more into the role of performer? What was the impact of photography? Students will study original source material. Their work will be judged by their skill conducting class discussions the depth of their analysis in several essays and a final paper.

964,Interdisciplinary,IN504,Legal Practice And Procedures,This course is intended as the main conduit to the Lawrenceville Mock Trial Team and as such has as its practical goal the preparation of students to participate in those competitions. On a more broad front the course seeks to educate students on both the principles of the American legal system and the ways those principles are expressed during the course of an actual litigation. The course will take up differences between civil and criminal litigation; the rules of direct vs. cross-examination; and the definitions of various rules of evidence like hearsay. What for instance is its definition and what might be considered exceptions to that rule? Students should expect to read extensively and closely the details of an individual case and to write a number of openings closings and witness statements. They will also be expected to master the rules of courtroom procedure and to engage in extensive role-playing.

1748,Interdisciplinary,IN506,Forms We Live By,"Biologists distinguish between an organism�s form and its function. Architects weigh a building�s form against its use. Painters differentiate a picture�s form from its object. Philosophers separate reality�s form and its substance. Indeed almost all facets of human life have some concept of form. (We even have one here at Lawrenceville.) But what good is form? Why talk about it? How does it work? What after all is it? This course will look at definitions of form put forward by multiple disciplines - from statistics to sculpture literature to linguistics. By tracking form across myriad disciplines we will hope to learn more about why it has become so crucial to the ways that humans conceive and order their world. And by analyzing humanity�s formal achievements (Bach�s Fugues Leibniz�s calculus Frost�s poetry) we will begin to develop our own thoughts about why form matters how we value it and what its purpose is in our everyday lives.

Writers composed novels poems and films rich in social and philosophical complexity but always with underlying political commentary and agendas. In doing so they re-examined the foundations of western values such as individual rights social commitments duty freedom power sense spirituality and sanity. The questions they raised will be the same ones we raise and answer using literary texts. Is there something essentially ""human"" such as a human spirit and what is its constitution? What is the purpose of poetry when tanks are in the streets? To what degree does an individual owe allegiance to her moral ideals? Does language serve to reveal or to mask reality? Is sanity socially or transcendentally defined? We will read novels poems essays and films by writers from both sides of the Iron Curtain possibly including Schneider Koestler Milosz Havel Kundera Le Carr� Greene Kubrick Wajda von Dannersmarck Jean-Luc Godard Brodsky Barthes Derrida Nabokov Tarkovsky Sontag Cavell.

1302,Interdisciplinary,IN511,Modern Thought And Literature,"In Franz Kafka�s Metamorphosis Gregor Samsa wakes up one morning to discover that he�s not the person he thought he was�that everything he thought he knew about the world was somehow wrong.  At the heart of this interdisciplinary course is a sustained exploration of and confrontation with the radical uncertainty that characterizes modernity.  The technological cultural and social changes of the past two centuries have undermined and called into question our most basic values and foundational assumptions about how the world works challenging us to wrestle with some fundamental questions:  How do we know what we know?   What is right and good and beautiful�and how can we be certain?  What does it mean to live a meaningful life?  What does it mean to be human?  Through readings in literature and philosophy we�ll consider the ways a number of 19th- and 20th-century writers explored and tried to answer these imperative if perhaps unanswerable questions.  Readings for the course will include Marx�s Communist Manifesto Baudelaire�s poetry Nietzsche�s Twilight of the Idols Kafka�s Metamorphosis Woolf�s To the Lighthouse and Beckett�s Waiting for Godot; at the end of the term we will visit The Met in New York city.
